## **Direction Vector Selection for R2-based Hypervolume Contribution Approximation**
### Direction Vector Selection
- Training solution sets are contained in "Data/Training". You can use "Data/generateTrainingData.m" to regenerate the training data.
- "VectorSelect.m" contains the greedy approximation error selection (GAES) method.
- The direction vector sets generated by different methods are contained in "Vector Set". The direction vector sets generated by the GAES method are contained in "Vector Set/Inclusion".
### Test on Six Regular Pareto Fronts
- Test solution sets are contained in "Data/Test". You can use "Data/generateTestData.m" to regenerate the test data.
### Application: GAHSS
- The candidate solution sets are contained in "Data/GAHSS_100K". These candidate solution sets come from paper "Benchmarking Subset Selection in Evolutionary Multi-objective Optimization" (https://github.com/SliverySky/BenchSS).
